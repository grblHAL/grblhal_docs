# Creating Vendor Profiles

The **[grblHAL Web Builder](https://webbuilder.grblhal.org/)** allows vendors to provide pre-configured firmware options for their machines. This guide details how to create and host your own machine profiles.

## Overview

To list your machines in the Web Builder, you need to:
1.  **Host a Repository:** Create a public GitHub repository to store your profiles.
2.  **Create Profile Files:** Create JSON files defining the configuration for each machine.
3.  **Create an Index:** Create a `profiles.json` file that lists your available machines.
4.  **Register:** Submit your repository to be added to the Web Builder's main list.

## 1. Directory Structure

We recommend a structure similar to the [Sienci Labs](https://github.com/Sienci-Labs/grblhal-profiles) or [Ooznest](https://github.com/ooznest/grblhal-profiles) profiles:

```text
my-grblhal-profiles/
├── profiles.json        # Main index file
└── profiles/            # Folder containing individual machine configurations
    ├── my-router.json
    └── my-lathe.json
```

### Reference Implementation
**Sienci Labs** and **Ooznest** maintain profile repositories for their machines. You can use either repository as a template or reference for structuring your own files.

*   **GitHub Repository:** [Sienci-Labs/grblhal-profiles](https://github.com/Sienci-Labs/grblhal-profiles)
*   **GitHub Repository:** [ooznest/grblhal-profiles](https://github.com/ooznest/grblhal-profiles)

## 2. The Index File (`profiles.json`)

This file tells the Web Builder which machines you offer. It must be located at the root of your repository.

**Example `profiles.json`:**
```json
{
  "machines": [
    {
      "name": "My CNC Router 3018",
      "profileURL": "https://github.com/YourOrg/grblhal-profiles/blob/main/profiles/router3018.json",
      "URL": "https://your-website.com/product/router3018",
      "type": "router",
      "description": "A beginner-friendly desktop CNC router."
    },
    {
      "name": "Pro Lathe X1",
      "profileURL": "https://github.com/YourOrg/grblhal-profiles/blob/main/profiles/lathe_x1.json",
      "URL": "https://your-website.com/product/lathe-x1",
      "type": "lathe",
      "description": "High-precision turning center."
    }
  ]
}
```

*   **profileURL:** The link to the individual JSON file (the builder will automatically convert this to a raw link).
*   **URL:** A link to your product page (optional).

## 3. Machine Profile JSON

Each machine file (e.g., `profiles/router3018.json`) defines the specific settings and compile-time options. It supports a base configuration and multiple "variants".

**Structure:**
```json
{
  "machine": {
    "default_driver": "STM32F4xx",
    "default_board": "BOARD_MY_CUSTOM_V1",
    "default_symbols": {
      "NETWORKING_ENABLE": 1,
      "SDCARD_ENABLE": 1
    },
    "setting_defaults": {
      "DEFAULT_X_STEPS_PER_MM": 200,
      "DEFAULT_X_MAX_RATE": 5000
    }
  },
  "variants": [
    {
      "name": "Standard (3-Axis)",
      "default_symbols": { "N_AXIS": 3 }
    },
    {
      "name": "Pro (4-Axis)",
      "default_symbols": { "N_AXIS": 4 },
      "setting_defaults": { "DEFAULT_A_STEPS_PER_MM": 8.88 }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Symbols vs. Defaults

It is crucial to understand the difference between **Symbols** and **Defaults**:

#### **Symbols (`default_symbols`)**
These correspond to **Compile-Time options** (C Preprocessor `#define`). They determine *what features are built into the firmware*.
*   **Examples:** Enabling Wi-Fi, changing the number of axes, enabling specific plugins (Trinamic drivers, WebUI).
*   **Impact:** Changing these requires re-compiling the firmware.
*   **Lookup:** These are the names found in `my_machine.h` or usually prefixed with `ENABLE_` in the code.
*   **Web Builder UI:** These symbols control which checkboxes and dropdowns are selected in the Web Builder interface.

#### **Defaults (`setting_defaults`)**
These correspond to **Runtime Settings** (EEPROM values). They set the *default values* for `$` settings (like Steps/mm), so the user doesn't have to manually configure them after flashing.
*   **Examples:** Steps per mm (`$100`, `DEFAULT_X_STEPS_PER_MM`), Max Velocity (`$110`, `DEFAULT_X_MAX_RATE`), Pulse microseconds (`$0`, `DEFAULT_STEP_PULSE_MICROSECONDS`).
*   **Impact:** These values are loaded into the specific controller's defaults.
*   **Lookup:**
    *   **Standard Settings (`$`...):** Look for `#define DEFAULT_...` entries in [config.h](https://github.com/grblHAL/core/blob/master/config.h) (e.g., `DEFAULT_X_STEPS_PER_MM`).
    *   **Driver Settings (`$301`...):** Look for names in [driver_opts.h](https://github.com/grblHAL/core/blob/master/driver_opts.h).

## 4. Publishing

Once your profiles are ready, you can request to be added to the Web Builder. This is typically done by contacting the grblHAL maintainers.
