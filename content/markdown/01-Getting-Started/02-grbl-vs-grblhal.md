## Architecture: The Fundamental Difference

### **Original Grbl**
Grbl was designed specifically for 8-bit AVR microcontrollers (primarily the Arduino Uno). The code was tightly integrated with the hardware, making it:
- **Difficult to port** to other platforms
- **Limited by 8-bit constraints** in memory and processing power
- **Fragmented** when developers created independent 32-bit ports

### **grblHAL**
grblHAL introduces a **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)** that separates:
- **Core GRBL logic** (motion planning, G-code parsing, etc.)
- **Hardware-specific code** (GPIO, timers, interrupts, etc.)

This architecture makes grblHAL:
- **Easily portable** to new microcontroller platforms
- **Consistently updated** across all supported boards
- **Unified** with a single codebase for all platforms

## Performance Improvements

### **Step Rate & Speed**

**Original Grbl:**
- Maximum step rate: ~30 kHz
- Limits machine speed and microstepping resolution
- Can struggle with complex G-code containing many short segments

**grblHAL:**
- Step rates of 250-600 kHz depending on hardware
- Enables higher machine speeds
- Supports finer microstepping (1/256) without sacrificing speed
- Handles complex toolpaths smoothly

**Real-world impact:** You can run your machine faster, use higher microstepping for smoother motion, or both.

### **Processing Power**

**Original Grbl:**
- 16 MHz 8-bit processor
- Limited lookahead buffer
- Struggles with rapid direction changes

**grblHAL:**
- 40-600 MHz 32-bit processors
- Larger lookahead buffers
- Smoother motion through complex curves
- More headroom for additional features

## Feature Enhancements

## Migration Path

### **Should You Upgrade from Grbl to grblHAL?**

**Consider grblHAL if you:**

- Need plugin support for custom features

**Stick with Grbl if you:**
- Have an Arduino Uno-based setup that works perfectly
- Don't need advanced features
- Want the simplicity of the original
- Have legacy toolchains dependent on Grbl

### **Is My G-code Compatible?**

**Good news:** grblHAL is **backwards compatible** with Grbl G-code. Your existing programs will work, but you'll also be able to use more advanced G-code features.

## Cost Considerations

**Original Grbl:**
- Arduino Uno: ~$5-25
- CNC shield: ~$5-15
- **Total: ~$10-40**

**grblHAL:**

**Verdict:** grblHAL can be **equally affordable** while offering significantly more features and performance.

## Compatibility with Senders

Both Grbl and grblHAL work with popular G-code senders:

- **Universal Gcode Sender (UGS)**
- **CNCjs**
- **bCNC**
- **ioSender** (optimized for grblHAL)
- **Candle**
- **gSender**

Most senders work with both, though some may need minor configuration adjustments for grblHAL-specific features.
